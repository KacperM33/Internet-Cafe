# ☕ Internet Cafe - Desktop Application Project
This project is a desktop application designed to support the daily operations of an internet café. It allows users to register their session time and calculates the corresponding payment based on their usage. Additionally, users can rent available games directly through the system. Administrators have access to a secure panel where they can view user activity history and export usage data for further analysis.

## 📚 About This Project
This project was completed as the final assignment for the *Object-Oriented Programming* course during my engineering studies.

## 🧰 Development Tools
- Java
- Swing (Java)

## ✍️ Conclusion
I know this application doesn’t look perfect, but it was my first desktop project and also one of the first projects I worked on during my studies.<br>
The main goal was to keep the functionality simple and the interface clear. I didn’t have much time to develop it, and I was required to use Swing, which is an outdated GUI library with limited design capabilities, as it was part of the project requirements. Still, it was a great learning experience.
